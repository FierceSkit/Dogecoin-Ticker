                                                When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive
                                                source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things.
                                            </p>
                                            <p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if
                                                you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
                                            <p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode.
                                                If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit. And you
                                                must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
                                            <p> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
                                            <p> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they
                                                have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others.</p>
                                            <p> Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license
                                                from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
                                            <p> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different
                                                from the ordinary General Public License. We usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs.</p>
                                            <p> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinaryGeneral
                                                Public License therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because itdoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary GeneralPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These
                                                disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is
                                                that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
                                            <p> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library innon-free
                                                programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operatingsystem.</p>
                                            <p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of theusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program
                                                using a modified version of the Library.</p>
                                            <p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". Theformer contains
                                                code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run.</p>
                                            <h5 id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h5>
                                            <p><strong>0.</strong>This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the
                                                terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
                                            <p> A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
                                            <p> The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law:
                                                that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without
                                                limitation in the term "modification".)</p>
                                            <p> "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface
                                                definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.</p>
                                            <p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a
                                                program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what
                                                the program that uses the Library does.</p>
                                            <p><strong>1.</strong>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate
                                                copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary.</p>
                                            <p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.</p>
                                            <p><strong>2.</strong>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
                                                1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
                                                <li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>
                                                <li><strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>
                                                <li><strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
                                                    facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
                                                    of its purpose remains meaningful.
                                                    <p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied
                                                        function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiablesections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can bereasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
                                                thenthis License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when youdistribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the samesections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library,
                                                thedistribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus toeach and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
                                            <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest yourrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercisethe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
                                                worksbased on the Library.</p>
                                            <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library withthe Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storageor distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                                                the scope ofthis License.</p>
                                            <p><strong>3.</strong>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
                                                License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then
                                                you can specifythat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change inthese notices.</p>
                                            <p> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
                                            <p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
                                            <p><strong>4.</strong>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit
                                                with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
                                            <p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the
                                                source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
                                            <p><strong>5.</strong>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such
                                                awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
                                            <p> However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary".
                                                The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
                                            <p> When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether
                                                this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
                                            <p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted,
                                                regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
                                            <p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not
                                                they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
                                            <p><strong>6.</strong>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
                                                workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
                                            <p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the workduring
                                                execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do oneof these
                                                things:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections
                                                    1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify
                                                    the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
                                                    be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)</li>
                                                <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer
                                                    system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible
                                                    with the version that the work was made with.</li>
                                                <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing

                                            <p> For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,the materials
                                                to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable
                                                runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.</p>
                                            <p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and
                                                the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.</p>

                                                a combined library, provided that the separate distribution ofthe work based on the Library and of the other library facilities isotherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

                                                <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections
                                                    above.
                                                </li>
                                                <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>

                                                the Library is void, and will automaticallyterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who havereceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not havetheir licenses terminated
                                                so long as such parties remain in fullcompliance.</p>

                                                areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall
                                                its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.</p>
                                            <p><strong>10.</strong>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
                                                the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third

                                                agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
                                                under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
                                                Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>

                                                on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.</p>

                                            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions
